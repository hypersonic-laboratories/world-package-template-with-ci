When you push changes to your repository, it automatically:This template provides an automated deployment pipeline for Helix packages. When you push changes to your repository, it automatically:

1. ✅ Creates a compressed archive from your `content` and `scripts` folders1. ✅ Creates a gzipped tar archive from your `content` and `scripts` folders

2. ✅ Updates your package version via the Helix API2. ✅ Creates a new package version via the Helix API

3. ✅ Uploads your package to the Helix CDN3. ✅ Uploads your package to the Helix CDN

4. ✅ Makes your changes live in the Helix ecosystem4. ✅ Makes your package available in the Helix ecosystem

## 📋 Prerequisites## 📋 Quick Start

- A Helix workspace (created in the Helix Game Client)### 1. Use This Template

- A GitHub repository for your workspace

- A Helix API access tokenClick "Use this template" → "Create a new repository" to create your own package repository.

## 🎯 Quick Setup (3 Steps)### 2. Set Up Your API Token

### Step 1: Copy the GitHub Actions Folder1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

2. Click **New repository secret**

Copy the `.github` folder from this template into your Helix workspace repository:3. Add:

- **Name**: `ACCESS_TOKEN`

```bash - **Secret**: Your Helix API authentication token

# From this template repository

cp -r .github /path/to/your/workspace/### 3. Update Package Metadata

```

Edit `metadata.json` with your package information:

Your workspace should have this structure:

````json

```{

your-workspace/  "package": {

├── .github/              # ← The folder you just copied    "id": "YOUR-PACKAGE-UUID",

│   ├── workflows/    "creatorId": "YOUR-CREATOR-UUID",

│   │   └── deploy.yml    "name": "Your Package Name",

│   └── actions/    "slug": "your-package-slug",

│       ├── create-package-archive/    "description": "Your package description",

│       ├── create-package-version/    "type": "World",

│       └── upload-package-files/    "contentRating": "Everyone",

├── content/              # Your workspace content (auto-generated by Helix)    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],

├── scripts/              # Your workspace scripts (if any)    "isPrivate": true

└── metadata.json         # Your workspace metadata (auto-generated by Helix)  },

```  "dependencyIds": ["dependency-uuid-1", "dependency-uuid-2"]

}

### Step 2: Add Your API Token to GitHub```



1. Go to your repository on GitHub**Important**: Replace `YOUR-PACKAGE-UUID` with your actual package UUID from the Helix platform.

2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

3. Click **New repository secret**### 4. Add Your Package Content

4. Add the secret:

   - **Name**: `ACCESS_TOKEN`Replace the content in these folders with your package files:

   - **Secret**: Your Helix API authentication token

````

### Step 3: Push and Deploy!your-repo/

├── content/ # REQUIRED - Your package content (maps, assets, etc.)

Commit and push the `.github` folder to your repository:│ └── map.json

├── scripts/ # OPTIONAL - Your package scripts

````bash│ └── ...

git add .github└── metadata.json     # Package metadata

git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"```

git push

```### 5. Push to Deploy



That's it! From now on, every push to the `main` branch will automatically deploy your workspace.Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch:



## 🔧 Configuration```bash

git add .

### Change the Deployment Branchgit commit -m "Update package content"

git push

By default, the workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.```



To change this, edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (line 6):The GitHub Action will automatically run and deploy your package! 🎉



```yaml## ⚙️ Configuration

on:

    push:### API URL Configuration

        branches:

            - main  # Change this to your preferred branchThe workflow uses the staging API by default: `https://helix-backend-staging.up.railway.app`

````

To change the API URL:

### Change the API URL

1. Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

By default, the workflow uses the staging API: `https://helix-backend-staging.up.railway.app`2. Find the `apiUrl` default value (around line 9)

3. Change it to your desired API endpoint

To change this, edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (line 12):

````yaml

```yamlapiUrl:

default: "https://helix-backend-staging.up.railway.app"  # Change this  description: "API URL"

```  required: true

  type: string

### Deploy to Multiple Branches  default: "https://your-api-url.com" # Change this

````

You can configure the workflow to deploy from multiple branches:

### Branch Configuration

````yaml

on:By default, the workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.

5. Click **Run workflow**

**Solution**: Make sure your workspace has a `content/` folder. This is automatically created by the Helix Game Client.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### Error: id not found in metadata.json

`````

**Solution**: .

- Ensure your `metadata.json` file exists and was generated by Helix├── .github/

- Check that the `id` field is present in the root of the JSON│   ├── workflows/

- Don't manually edit this file│   │   └── deploy.yml                    # Main deployment workflow

│   └── actions/

### Error: Failed to update package version (HTTP 401)│       ├── create-package-archive/       # Creates tar.gz from folders

│       │   └── action.yml

**Solution**:│       ├── create-package-version/       # Calls API to create version

- Verify your `ACCESS_TOKEN` secret is set correctly in repository settings│       │   └── action.yml

- Check that the token hasn't expired│       └── upload-package-files/         # Uploads to pre-signed URLs

- Ensure the token has the correct permissions for your package│           └── action.yml

**Solution**:└── README.md                             # This file

- The package version ID in `metadata.json` doesn't exist```

- Make sure you've created the package version in Helix first

- Verify the `id` in `metadata.json` matches an existing version## 🔧 Customization



### Scripts folder not included in deployment### Modifying the Workflow



**Solution**:The workflow is built with modular composite actions, making it easy to customize:

- Ensure your `scripts/` folder exists in your workspace

- The folder must contain at least one file to be included- **create-package-archive** - Modify how archives are created

- Check the workflow logs to confirm it detected the scripts folder- **create-package-version** - Customize API requests or payload

- **upload-package-files** - Change upload behavior or add retry logic

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Example: Adding Version Names

- ✅ Never commit your API token to the repository

- ✅ Always use GitHub Secrets for sensitive dataEdit `.github/actions/create-package-version/action.yml` to include version names in the API payload.

- ✅ The `ACCESS_TOKEN` secret is only accessible to workflow runs

- ✅ Pre-signed upload URLs expire automatically## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- ✅ Keep your repository private if it contains proprietary content

### Error: 'content' folder is required but not found

## 📚 Advanced Usage

**Solution**: Make sure you have a `content/` folder in your repository root with files in it.

### Customizing the Workflow

### Error: package.id not found in metadata.json

The workflow uses modular composite actions located in `.github/actions/`:

**Solution**:

- **create-package-archive/** - Creates the tar.gz archive

- **create-package-version/** - Calls the Helix API to update the version- Check that your `metadata.json` has the correct structure

- **upload-package-files/** - Uploads to pre-signed URLs- Verify the `package.id` field is set with a valid UUID



You can modify these actions to customize the deployment process.### Error: Failed to create package version (HTTP 401)



### Example: Adding Notifications**Solution**:



Add a notification step to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:- Verify your `ACCESS_TOKEN` secret is set correctly in repository settings

- Check that the token hasn't expired

```yaml- Ensure the token has the correct permissions

- name: Notify on success

  if: success()### Error: Failed to upload to client/server URL

  run: |

    echo "Deployment successful! 🎉"**Solution**:

    # Add your notification logic here (Slack, Discord, etc.)

```- Pre-signed URLs expire after a certain time

- Re-run the workflow to get fresh upload URLs

### Example: Conditional Deployments- Check that your archive was created successfully



Deploy only when specific files change:### Scripts folder not included



```yaml**Solution**:

on:

  push:- Ensure your `scripts/` folder exists in the repository root

    branches:- Check the workflow logs to see if it detected the scripts folder

      - main- The folder must contain at least one file

    paths:

      - 'content/**'## 📚 API Reference

      - 'scripts/**'
